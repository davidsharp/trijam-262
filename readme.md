# Trijam 262 - Wall bounce

Notes:
- mouse controlled "ship"
- balls bouncing
- avoid balls
- balls squish when hitting walls
- mouse press rotates but also accelerates
- reusable splash/game over with timed textboxes (based on scene children)
- timer is score, possibly reward near misses
- particles on death
- stretch ship when accelerating

Plan:
- Hour 1: basic gameplay using godot logo as assets
- Hour 2: simple graphics, sounds and juice
- Hour 3: spare hour for polish?
